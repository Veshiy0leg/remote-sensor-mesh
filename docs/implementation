This document outlines goals and plans related to implementation of simple, remote  distributed IoT mesh of devices in hazardous area.

Version 1 started on March 27th, 2020

Sensor spec:
    ESP32 with WiFi radio onboard and Li-ion 3.7V battery. 
    Demo unit is built using: ESP32-DevKitC-32D ( https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Espressif-Systems/ESP32-DevKitC-32D )

    Temp and Humidity option: https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-dht11-dht22-temperature-humidity-web-server-arduino-ide/

Node spec:
    Raspberry Pi board with WiFi operating in AP mode. The node could be on the drone to be in the mesh area once per data-gathering period.

Demo will have 2 sensors gathering sensor data with one measurement per 10 seconds rate.
Node will be introduced in intermittent fashion and collect data from sensors.
For demo purposes the Deep Sleep on sensors may be omitted.
